# Unity Git Repository Manager

A git repository manager for Unity with a focus on ease of use and fast iteration. 
Allows you to include repositories or subfolders of repositories from other projects in your unity project, update and modify them.

This is a tool for working on many repositories at once and pushing changes back. It uses a shallow, sparse checkout to only store the files you activley need for development from each repo.

# Features

- Add and update repositories
- Store only needed development files
- Allow for separate checkout of multiple folders from the same repository.
- Make modifications to repositories and push changes back.

# Installation
### Simple Install

- Download or clone this repository.
  - copy Assets/Package anywhere under your project's Assets folder.
  - Find the repository manager under Window/RepositoryManager.
  - You can now add, and update git repository and subfolders via the provided UI.
  
### UPM

- Right now no Unity package has been uploaded to the repository. UPM will not work. 

# Rationale

We have constantly run into the issue of decoupling into separate repositories slowing down development. We have multiple repositories for a single project, it gets quite slow.
But when we don't decouple we end up with unmaintainable and un-reusable monoliths. We need a way to quickly iterate on multiple repositories while maintaining their modularity. This is what the repo manager tries to solve. 

#### Problems with package managers
Package managers are in my experience geared for a read-only workflow, so they don't satisfy the same use case ([upm](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-parts.html), [projeny](https://github.com/modesttree/projeny), [nuget](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity)). I want it to be quick to update, have dependency management, but more importantly, be able to quickly __push changes__

#### Problems with git submodules
Git submodules are the closest thing to this. It would be _loveley_ if it worked but there is one big issue:
git submodules **[do not](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5303496/how-to-change-a-git-submodule-to-point-to-a-subfolder) [support](https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/8sanj7/create_subfolder_using_a_subfolder_from_a/) pulling only subfolders**.

##### Why do you need to pull subfolders? 
- Often when developing plugins the plugin project itself is located in the same repository.
- We sometimes have test scenes or other irrelevant assets we do not want to include. These bloat the dependents.
- In a unity project, we have the folders that exist outside (ProjectSettings, etc.) of assets. We don't want to include those in a project that uses it as a submodule

I've heard people argue that when you need a subfolder what you need to do is split into 2 repositories. but just because you want to share your assets folder separately to your project does not mean that they are decoupled. In the name of cohesion and sanity, this is a bad idea!

##### Git sparse checkout
This is where sparse checkout comes in. The approach we take is to sparse checkout only the folders and files you need, directly inside your active unity project (and possibly inside another git repository). This satisfies a number of requirements:
- No bloated history or unnecessary files.
- No copying or symlinks
- Directly make modifications and push them back to the main repository (A little like SVN)

Originally, this project was based on a repository cache, where the files were manually synced between the project and the repository, but since then sparse checkout has matured and we have refactored to use it inline, which has proved a lot simpler.

##### How do you have a git repository inside another one?
We have chosen to programmatically rename the .git folder to .gitsubrepository when no git commands are running on the subrepositories. The .gitsubrepository folder is treated like a normal directory, and can be committed to the parent repository without issue. You could ignore the sub repository in the parent repo if that's the behavior you desire.

### In Summary
Updating multiple repositories is slow, monoliths are bad. We need a way to update multiple repositories fast.
The use case we have described does not satisfy the same use case as UPM or any other package managers I'm aware of. The intention is for this to be used in parallel with the Unity Package Manager. This is for in-development or project-oriented repositories, It allows for us to keep modular and atomic repositories that are reusable while maintaining the ease of use and mutability of a single project workflow. 

_Packages should still be used for third party projects or projects no longer in active development!_

# Technology

- Supports [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and macOS
- Tested with [Unity 2019.2](https://unity.com/)
- c# [.NET standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard)
- Uses c# tasks to run git console commands in a separate thread. Supports 2FA.


# Dependency Schema
Each dependency that you add is encoded into a json file (Dependencies.json) which is stored in the root of the repositories folder. Each entry looks as follows:

```
{
    "Name": "MyCoolRepo",
    "SubFolder": "Assets/FolderToInclude",
    "Url": "https://github.com/RenderHeads/MyCoolRepo",
    "Branch": "master"
}
```
-  "Name"  - the name of the module you are adding as a dependency
-  "SubFolder" - the subfolder within the repo you wan to check out
-  "Url" - The url of the repo to check out
- "Branch" - the branch in the repo you are checking out.

# Contributing

This project is in the early stages, there are many easy bugs to squash and many features that would be useful. Ill outline issues as they become apparent.

If you give it a try, use it on a project, or just want to discuss the ideology of this approach please let us know!
